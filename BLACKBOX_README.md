 ### Laravel API Routes

This `README.md` file provides a detailed explanation of the API routes defined in the provided PHP code snippet. The code defines routes for user authentication and password reset using Laravel's built-in authentication scaffolding.

#### 1. Route Middleware:
   - The `api` middleware group is applied to all routes defined within the `Route::middleware('api')` block. This middleware is typically used to protect API routes from unauthorized access.

#### 2. User Authentication Routes:
   - The `Route::middleware('api')->prefix('auth')->group(function () {...})` block defines a group of routes specifically for user authentication. The `prefix` option adds the `/auth` prefix to all routes within this group.

#### 3. Login Route:
   - `Route::post('login', [AuthController::class, 'login']);` defines a POST route for user login. When a user sends a POST request to the `/auth/login` endpoint, the `login` method of the `AuthController` class will be executed to handle the login process.

#### 4. Logout Route:
   - `Route::post('logout', [AuthController::class, 'logout']);` defines a POST route for user logout. When a user sends a POST request to the `/auth/logout` endpoint, the `logout` method of the `AuthController` class will be executed to handle the logout process.

#### 5. Refresh Route:
   - `Route::post('refresh', [AuthController::class, 'refresh']);` defines a POST route for refreshing the user's access token. When a user sends a POST request to the `/auth/refresh` endpoint, the `refresh` method of the `AuthController` class will be executed to generate a new access token.

#### 6. Me Route:
   - `Route::post('me', [AuthController::class, 'me']);` defines a POST route for retrieving the currently authenticated user's information. When a user sends a POST request to the `/auth/me` endpoint, the `me` method of the `AuthController` class will be executed to fetch and return the user's data.

#### 7. Forgot Password Route:
   - `Route::post('forgot-password', [PasswordResetLinkController::class, 'store']);` defines a POST route for initiating the password reset process. When a user sends a
